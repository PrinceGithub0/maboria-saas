      <h1 className="text-3xl font-semibold">Terms of Service</h1>
      <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">Last updated: December 15, 2025</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Maboria is a subscription software platform for business automation, invoicing, subscriptions, payments, and
        AI-assisted workflows. These Terms apply to anyone who accesses or uses the Maboria website or services.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">2. Account &amp; Access</h2>
      <p>
        You are responsible for your account details, passwords, and any activity under your account. If you invite team
        members, you are responsible for their access and actions. Please keep your login secure and use two-factor
        authentication if available.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree to use the service only for lawful business purposes and not to abuse, disrupt, or attempt to access
        other accounts or systems.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">3. Subscriptions &amp; Payments</h2>
      <p>
        Maboria offers paid plans with usage limits. Payments are processed by Flutterwave and Paystack in supported
        currencies. Billing is in advance and subscriptions auto-renew unless you cancel before the next billing date.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trials may be offered for a limited period. If a trial is started, it will convert to a paid subscription unless
        canceled. Refunds are handled fairly on a case-by-case basis and where required by law.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">4. AI Features</h2>
      <p>
        AI features generate suggestions and outputs based on your inputs and data. AI outputs may be incomplete or
        incorrect, and you remain responsible for decisions made using AI results.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">5. Data &amp; Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        You own your business data. We use your data only to provide and improve the service, and we do not sell your
        data. Please review the Privacy Policy for details.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">6. Availability &amp; Changes</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to keep the service available and reliable, but outages and maintenance can happen. We may change or
        improve features over time and will provide reasonable notice when changes are significant.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">7. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        You can cancel your subscription at any time in your dashboard. We may suspend or restrict access only for
        abuse, fraud, security concerns, or legal requirements, and we will try to notify you when possible.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">8. Liability Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        The service is provided on an &quot;as-is&quot; basis. We are not responsible for indirect, incidental, or
        consequential losses, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">9. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by applicable laws. Any disputes will be handled by courts that have proper
        jurisdiction under those laws.
      </p>
